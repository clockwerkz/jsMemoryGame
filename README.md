## TODO

- [x] Write a function that will create the game board
- [ ] Implement a timer that starts when the first card is clicked
- [ ] Implement the scoring system; A star rating that is based on player performance
- [ ] Create a "Game Over" modal that shows the Final Score and a "Start a New Game"
- [ ] Write a function that will reset the board and game variables to start a new game


## Wistlist
- Have a complete game system, with a Start Game Button and an instructions modal
- Create keyboard inputs for the game: I had an idea about using WASD to be able move a "Cursor" between the various cards on the board, and use the spacebar to reveal the currently selected card.
- LEADERBOARD! I would love to have a leaderboard in the game. The project description mentions using local storage, but I would love to create an API that can keep track of player scores. So at the end of the game, a player who is, say, top 10, can enter their name in a form box and be added to the High School Leaderboard.
